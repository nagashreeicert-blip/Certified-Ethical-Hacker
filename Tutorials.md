# 📘 Ethical Hacking Tutorials

Beginner-Friendly, Step-by-Step Learning Guide

These tutorials help you understand Ethical Hacking from zero knowledge to practical, job-ready cybersecurity skills. Perfect for beginners, students, IT professionals, and anyone entering the cybersecurity and penetration testing field.

# 🟡 1. Introduction to Ethical Hacking
✔️ What You Will Learn

What is Ethical Hacking?

Why organizations hire ethical hackers

Types of hackers: White Hat, Black Hat, Grey Hat

Key security concepts (CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

Real-world examples of cyberattacks & ethical hacking interventions

⭐ Key Takeaways

Ethical hacking helps identify vulnerabilities before attackers do.

Ethical hackers work with legal permission to secure systems.

# 🟡 2. Cybersecurity & Attack Basics
✔️ Topics Covered

What is cybersecurity?

Types of cyberattacks

Malware, ransomware, trojans, spyware basics

Vulnerabilities vs threats vs exploits

Security controls (administrative, technical, physical)

⭐ Simple Example

Scanning a network to find open ports → prevents attackers from exploiting weak entry points.

# 🟡 3. Understanding the Ethical Hacking Lifecycle

The core framework of penetration testing.

✔️ Phases

Reconnaissance – Information gathering (passive & active)

Scanning – Identifying live hosts, ports & services

Enumeration – Extracting detailed system information

Gaining Access – Exploiting vulnerabilities

Maintaining Access – Persistence techniques

Covering Tracks – Clearing logs & traces (ethical practice for learning)

⭐ Why the Lifecycle Matters

It provides a structured, safe, and legal approach to testing system security.

# 🟡 4. Footprinting & Reconnaissance Tools
✔️ Learn:

What is footprinting?

Types: Passive vs Active

Social engineering basics

Tools: WHOIS, DNS lookup, Google hacking (OSINT), Shodan

How to gather non-intrusive intelligence legally

⭐ Example

Using WHOIS to identify domain ownership → helps assess potential attack surfaces.

# 🟡 5. Scanning & Enumeration Essentials
✔️ Topics

Network scanning (Nmap basics)

Port scanning techniques (TCP, UDP)

Vulnerability scanning

Banner grabbing

SNMP, SMB, LDAP enumeration

⭐ Why Scanning Matters

It shows which services, ports, and hosts are vulnerable before attackers find them.

# 🟡 6. System Hacking & Malware Concepts
✔️ Tools & Techniques You Will Learn

Password cracking basics

Privilege escalation fundamentals

Spyware, keyloggers & trojan concepts

ARP poisoning, MITM basics

Common malware attack patterns (explained safely & ethically)

⭐ Example

Understanding how keyloggers work → helps defend systems and detect suspicious behavior.

# 🟡 7. Web Application Hacking Fundamentals
✔️ Learn:

Web architecture basics

OWASP Top 10 overview

SQL Injection (concept)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Broken authentication basics

Safe testing environments (DVWA, Juice Shop)

⭐ Example

Testing a login page on a lab environment for input validation flaws → improves security controls.

# 🟡 8. Wireless Security & Network Protection
✔️ Topics

Wi-Fi security protocols (WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPA3)

Wireless sniffing basics

Rogue AP & Evil Twin concepts

MAC spoofing

Wireless defense mechanisms

⭐ Simple Example

Detecting a rogue access point in your network → prevents unauthorized access.

# 🟡 9. Cyber Defense & Incident Handling
✔️ Concepts

Firewalls & IDS/IPS basics

Log monitoring

SIEM overview

Patch management

Incident response: Identify → Contain → Eradicate → Recover

Threat intelligence fundamentals

⭐ Example

Using log monitoring tools to detect unusual login attempts → prevents a security breach.

# 🟡 10. Ethical Hacking Exam Preparation Tutorial
✔️ What You Will Learn

Exam syllabus overview

Question types (MCQs, scenario-based)

Study plan (1-week, 2-week, 30-day)

Must-know tools (Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Wireshark)

Common attack scenarios & defensive strategies

Tips to pass on the first attempt
